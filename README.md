# DeadDrop
### Provably Anonymous Whistleblowing — Powered by Chainlink Confidential AI

> *SecureDrop asks you to trust a server. DeadDrop gives you a cryptographic proof before you hit send.*

**ETHGlobal New York 2026 · Chainlink Track**

## The Problem

Every year, billions of dollars in financial fraud go unreported. Not because people don't know — but because they can't prove they're insiders without revealing themselves.

The SEC Whistleblower Program pays 10–30% of sanctions over $1 million to eligible reporters. The requirement: *original information from an independent source*. The bottleneck: whistleblowers cannot prove they're verified insiders without exposing their identity.

Traditional anonymous reporting platforms like SecureDrop solve anonymity through operational security — they ask you to trust a server, a process, a human. That trust is a vulnerability.

**DeadDrop eliminates that trust requirement entirely.**

---

## What DeadDrop Does

DeadDrop is a whistleblowing platform where a verified employee submits a sensitive claim and receives cryptographic proof — before they hit send — that:

1. They are a confirmed insider (employee verification inside TEE)
2. Their claim was independently assessed by a 4-agent AI pipeline (Confidential AI inside TEE)
3. Their identity was mathematically stripped — unknowable to anyone
4. The verdict was posted on-chain and is publicly verifiable by anyone with the tx hash

The whistleblower can hand a regulator a transaction hash. That hash proves a verified insider submitted credible information — without revealing who they are. **This is the first cryptographic infrastructure for whistleblower credibility without identity exposure.**

## Why This Only Works With Chainlink

Every component is load-bearing:

| Component | Why It's Required |
|---|---|
| **Chainlink TEE** | The AI agent runs inside the enclave — not even Chainlink operators can see the reasoning |
| **Confidential HTTP** | Employee verification and AI inference both happen inside the enclave — no PII ever exits |
| **Confidential AI Attester** | The AI verdict is cryptographically signed by the TEE — it cannot be faked or altered |
| **CRE Workflow** | Orchestrates the full pipeline on a Decentralized Oracle Network — no single point of failure |
| **On-chain Attestation** | The verdict is immutable public record — anyone can verify the proof |

**Why not AWS Nitro?** AWS TEEs exist but have no native on-chain proof. You'd trust a bridge. With Chainlink, the DON posts the attestation — no single point of trust, no bridge, no intermediary.

## The 4-Agent AI Pipeline

All 4 agents execute inside the Chainlink TEE via Confidential AI, each specialized for a different stage of triage and assessment. The reasoning is cryptographically attested — no one can view or alter it.

### Agent 1: Intake Triage
Quickly categorizes the claim and decides whether to proceed:
- `FINANCIAL_FRAUD`, `SECURITIES_VIOLATION`, `WORKPLACE_SAFETY`, `CORRUPTION`, `DATA_PRIVACY`, or `OTHER`
- Assigns a severity hint (1=minor, 2=serious, 3=critical)
- Routes the claim to the matching specialist agent

### Agent 2: Specialist Analysis (branches by category)
A category-specific specialist (Financial Forensics, Securities Compliance, OSHA Safety, Anti-Corruption, Data Privacy, or General Compliance) performs deep analysis:
- **Entity extraction** — people, organizations, financial amounts, dates, documents
- **Evidence scoring** — 1–10 for specificity, verifiability, and corroboration
- **Specific violations** — concrete alleged violations and key risks
- **Investigation steps** — recommended next steps

### Agent 3: Legal Assessment
Maps findings to U.S. whistleblower law (Dodd-Frank 21F, SOX 806, OSHA 11(c), False Claims Act, FCPA):
- Applicable laws and relevant agencies (SEC, DOJ, OSHA, etc.)
- Protection level: `STRONG` | `MODERATE` | `WEAK` | `NONE`
- **SEC Whistleblower Program**: SEC award eligibility (10–30% on sanctions over $1M)

### Agent 4: Verdict Synthesis (on-chain)
Synthesizes all prior agent outputs into the final attested verdict:
```json
{
  "credible": true,
  "severity": 3,
  "violation_type": "FINANCIAL_FRAUD",
  "route": "public",
  "reason": "Verified insider claim of financial fraud assessed as critical misconduct",
  "protection_level": "STRONG",
  "protected_disclosure": true,
  "sec_award_eligible": true,
  "recommended_agencies": ["SEC", "DOJ"],
  "entities": { "people": [], "organizations": [], "amounts": [], "dates": [], "documents": [] },
  "evidence_quality": 8,
  "identity": "UNKNOWABLE"
}
```

## CRE Workflow

Core pipeline using `@chainlink/cre-sdk`:

```typescript
// Step 1: Confidential HTTP — employee verification inside TEE
const confidentialHttp = new cre.capabilities.ConfidentialHTTPClient()
const verification = confidentialHttp.sendRequest(runtime, {
  request: { url: config.hr_api_url, method: 'POST', bodyString: ... }
}).result()

// Step 2: Confidential AI — 6-step agent assessment inside TEE
const verdict = confidentialHttp.sendRequest(runtime, {
  request: { url: 'confidential-ai-dev-preview.cldev.cloud/v1/inference', ... }
}).result()

// Step 3: Strip identity — only verdict exits enclave
const output = { ...verdict, identity: 'UNKNOWABLE' }

// Step 4: Write to chain
const encodedPayload = encodeAbiParameters([...], [credible, severity, route, reason, timestamp])
evmClient.writeReport(runtime, { receiver: registryAddress, report })
```

## Real-World Impact

The SEC Whistleblower Program has paid over **$1.9 billion** in awards since 2011. The average award is $5.4 million. The barrier is always the same: credibility without identity exposure.

DeadDrop attestations could:
- Accompany SEC filings as cryptographic proof of insider status
- Serve as evidence in OSHA retaliation cases
- Enable anonymous proof-of-insider for financial regulators globally
- Power compliance infrastructure for enterprise whistleblower programs

**This is not a privacy tool. This is infrastructure for the next generation of financial enforcement.**
